This repository is a showcase of my first use of Unity it features a 2D bullet hell style game that has three levels of varying difficulty and enemies.
It is a multi scene 2D game with a persistent player character between scenes with locked camera.
The goal of the game is to re unite the heart to the rib cage. The player uses WASD to move the heart through the stages dodging the projectiles and enemies.
All assets were hand made by Nathan Angel exclusively for use in this game.
